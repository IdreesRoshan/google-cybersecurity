## Overview
The Google Professional Cybersecurity Certificate taught me the importance of cybersecurity in protecting organisations from threats like unauthorised access and cyberattacks. I learned to identify, document and mitigate risks using tools like SIEM (Splunk, Chronicle) and gained hands-on experience with Python, Linux, and SQL as well as real-world cybersecurity scenarios. This program prepared me for real-world challenges and entry-level cybersecurity roles.
